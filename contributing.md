Bound a fug? Open an [issue](https://github.com/luketudge/spoonerize/issues).

If you would like to make changes, it is probably a good idea to discuss it first via an issue. But in general pull requests are welcome for:

* Fug bixes.
* Corrections / improvements to documentation.
* Improvements to the packaging process.

But not yet for few neatures.
