# Contributing

Open an [issue](https://github.com/luketudge/spoonerize/issues) for bug reports or problems.

If you would like to make changes, it is probably a good idea to discuss it first via an issue. But in general pull requests are welcome for:

* Bug fixes.
* Corrections / improvements to documentation.
* Fun usage examples for the documentation.
* Improvements to the packaging process.

But not yet for new features.
